Day 1 – Project Setup

Goal: Create the environment and folder structure for the Credit Card Fraud Detection project.

Steps:

Installed Python libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, streamlit, etc.).

Created virtual environment and project folder structure.

Downloaded Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset and placed it in data/.

Verified dataset loads correctly in a Jupyter notebook.

Result: Environment and data setup complete ✅

Next Step: Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand dataset distribution and imbalance.


Day 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Goal: Understand dataset characteristics, class imbalance, and important features before modeling.

Steps Taken:

Loaded dataset and verified shape: 284,807 rows × 31 columns.

Checked data types → no missing values found.

Found severe class imbalance: Fraudulent transactions ≈ 0.17% of total.

Transaction amount distribution is skewed; fraud transactions tend to have different average amounts than non-fraud.

Transaction time shows periodic patterns (may reflect day/night usage).

Correlation heatmap shows V-features (PCA components) have varying importance; Amount and Class show moderate correlation.

Key Results:

Dataset is clean, but imbalanced → special techniques (SMOTE, undersampling, anomaly detection) will be needed later.

Features are anonymized (V1–V28) but still useful.

Next Step: Perform Data Preprocessing (scaling, train-test split, handling imbalance).
